# Project Name: Electric vehicle analysis through machine learning using Pysparkï€ 
Environment: PySpark (Using Jupyter Notebook),
Description: Electric vehicles run at least half on electricity. Instead of using fuel-driven internal combustion
engines, these types of vehicles are working with electric motors for propulsion. The visualizations and
Discussions show the overall relationships between the variables we choose.
